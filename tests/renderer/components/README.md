# TimeEntries Component Tests

## Overview

This file contains comprehensive unit tests for the TimeEntries component's business logic and functionality. The tests are designed to verify the core behavior without depending on actual component rendering, making them fast and reliable.

## Test Coverage

### 1. Timer Context Integration (8 tests)
- Default state initialization
- Time formatting
- Timer start/stop operations
- Description, client, project, and task updates

### 2. Data Loading Operations (4 tests)
- Time entries loading
- Clients with relationships loading
- Application settings loading
- Default project retrieval

### 3. Time Entry Operations (4 tests)
- Time entry creation
- Time entry updates
- Time entry deletion
- IPC communication for database operations

### 4. Data Filtering and Grouping Logic (4 tests)
- Grouping entries by date
- Filtering projects by selected client
- Filtering tasks by selected project
- Identifying active vs completed entries

### 5. Form Validation Logic (3 tests)
- Manual entry form validation
- Rounding options validation
- Dependent dropdown selection logic

### 6. Time Calculation Logic (3 tests)
- Day total calculations
- Elapsed time for active timers
- Human-friendly duration formatting

### 7. Event Handling Logic (3 tests)
- Timer event handling
- Modal state management
- Delete confirmation logic

### 8. Auto-save Functionality (2 tests)
- Unsaved changes tracking
- Save timeout management

## Key Features Tested

### Timer Functionality
- ✅ Start/stop timer operations
- ✅ Time formatting and display
- ✅ Client/project/task selection
- ✅ Description updates with auto-save

### Data Management
- ✅ Loading all required data (clients, projects, tasks, entries)
- ✅ Optimized data loading with relationships
- ✅ Settings persistence and retrieval

### User Interface Logic
- ✅ Form validation for manual entries
- ✅ Dependent dropdown behavior
- ✅ Modal state management
- ✅ Active timer restrictions (edit/delete)

### Time Calculations
- ✅ Accurate elapsed time calculations
- ✅ Day total calculations including active timers
- ✅ Duration formatting (human-friendly)

### Event System
- ✅ Timer state change events
- ✅ UI interaction events
- ✅ Delete confirmation workflows

## Test Strategy

The tests focus on **business logic** rather than UI rendering, which makes them:
- **Fast**: No DOM manipulation or component mounting
- **Reliable**: No flaky UI interactions
- **Focused**: Testing actual functionality rather than implementation details
- **Maintainable**: Independent of styling and component structure changes

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run only TimeEntries tests
npm test -- tests/components/TimeEntries.test.jsx

# Run with verbose output
npm test -- tests/components/TimeEntries.test.jsx --reporter=verbose

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- tests/components/TimeEntries.test.jsx --watch
```

## Mock Strategy

The tests use comprehensive mocks for:
- Timer context functions
- Electron API calls
- Time entries data
- Client/project/task hierarchies

This ensures tests are isolated and don't depend on external systems while still verifying the integration points work correctly.
