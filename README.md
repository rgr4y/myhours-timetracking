### Invoice Templates
Invoice templates are stored in `src/main/templates/` and use Handlebars syntax. You can customize:
- Company branding
- Layout and styling
- Data presentation
- Colors and fonts

### Styling
The app uses Styled Components with a dark theme. Modify component styles in the respective React component files.
